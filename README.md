# AlpaServe
Repo of alpa's multi-model serving system.

This is the official implementation of our OSDI'23 paper: [AlpaServe: Statistical Multiplexing with Model Parallelism for Deep Learning Serving](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi23/presentation/li-zhouhan).

To reproduce all the main results in our paper, please check the [artifact folder](./osdi23_artifact/) and follow the instructions in it.

# AdaptAerve
Thanks to the AlpaServe Team, it is because of you that the AdaptServe work has been made possible. This repo also contain AdaptServe's dynamic multi-model serving system.

This is the official implementation of our HPSC'25 paper: [AdaptServe: Auto-Scalable DL Serving with Dynamic Model Parallelism](). The paper link will coming soon.

To reproduce all the main results in our paper, please check the [artifact folder](./hpsc25_artifact/).
